Py-BES
======

A Python client for accessing the Building Energy Asset Score API


Documentation
-------------

This is a Python client for accessing the U.S. Department of Energyâ€™s
Building Energy Asset Score API. This is "a national standardized tool
for assessing the physical and structural energy efficiency of commercial
and multifamily residential buildings."

Note this is not a publically accessible API, you will neeed to sign up as a
user and request an API key. You will also need the username and password, for
that user as well as the organization token. See:

* https://buildingenergyscore.energy.gov/
* https://buildingenergyscore.energy.gov/d/users/sign_up
* https://buildingenergyscore.energy.gov/api

This tool concentrates on the Preview Building API (API v2), though some
functionality has been provided for the v1 API.

Note the API requires a user_id and access_token to authenticate. These
can be supplied as parameters when you initialize the client but this is
not necessary if you supply your username and password to the client as it
will fetch one when it initializes. This is the recommended route (as long
as you are reusing the client).

Installation
------------

``pip install py-bes``


Usage:
------
Here is an example that will take you through a basic workflow of

1. Setting up an api user
2. Instatiating the client to connect to the API
3. Creating a preview building
4. Editing that building
5. Running the simulation and getting the results


.. code-block:: python

    ORG_TOKEN = your org token
    EMAIL = email associated with account
    PASSWORD = password associated with account
    FIRST_NAME = first name associated with account
    LAST_NAME = last name associated with account
    BASE_URL = 'https://api.labworks.org/api'   # test sandbox


## create a new api user (one time only)


.. code-block:: python

    create_api_user(
      ORG_TOKEN, EMAIL, PASSWORD, PASSWORD, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, BASE_URL
    )


## initialize client


.. code-block:: python

    client = BESClient(
        email=EMAIL,
        password=PASSWORD,
        organization_token=ORG_TOKEN,
        base_url=BASE_URL
    )


## get resource type mapping


.. code-block:: python

    resource_types = get_resource_type(client)



## Create a preview building


.. code-block:: python

    preview_building_1 = client.create_preview_building(
        assessment_type='Test',
        building_name='Preview Example 1',
        year_completed='1990',
        floor_area='100000',
        street='123 Street',
        city='Boring',

        orientation='North/South'
    )


## get the building details


.. code-block:: python

    building_id_1 = preview_building_1['building_id']
    building_details_1 = client.get_preview_building(building_id_1)

##  Update some details
### Update the water heater

This uses some v1 api calls.


.. code-block:: python

    block_1 = building_details_1['blocks'][0]

    fuel_types = resource_types['fuel_types']

    resources = client.get_block_resources('water_heater', block_1['block_id'])
    water_heater_id = resources[0]['water_heater_id']

    # not needed for update but allows you to see what can be set
    water_heater = client.get_resource('water_heater', water_heater_id)

    client.update_resource(
        'water_heater',
        water_heater_id,
        tank_insulation_r_value=11
      )

    client.update_resource(
        'water_heater',
        water_heater_id,
        fuel_type_id=fuel_types['electricity']['id']
    )


### set mode to editing


.. code-block:: python

    client.set_preview_building_status(building_id_1, 'edit_mode')



### update the floor type

The value for floor type is one of ``resource_types['floot_types'].keys()``

.. code-block:: python

    client.update_preview_building(
        building_id_1,
        block_1['block_id'],
        extras={'floor:floor_type': 'wood framed'}
    )


## Validate the building and run simulation

.. code-block:: python

    result = client.validate_preview_building(building_id_1)
    if result == 'valid':
      client.simulate_preview_building(building_id_1)


**Note simulating the building may take some time.**

### Get some details

.. code-block:: python

    status = client.get_preview_building(building_id_1)['status!']
    if status == 'Rated':
        details = client.get_preview_building(building_id, report_type='pdf')

details::

    {
        u'name': u'Preview Example 1',
        u'id': 344
        u'pdf_url': u'http://api.labworks.org/buildings/344/report.pdf',
        u'potential_energy_savings': 30,
        u'low_score': 3.5,
        u'potential_low_score': 6.0,
        u'high_score': 7.5,
        u'potential_high_score': 10.0,
        u'mean_eui': 158.85740661621094,
        u'min_eui': 88.42064666748047,
        u'max_eui': 250.76022338867188,
    }


Helper functions
----------------
Several helper functions have been included in pybes.utils to facilitate initiating simulations and downloading report results
get_bes_buildings is a generator function which yields the building report and building type ('Preview', 'Full') for all rated buildings by calling get_bes_full_report and get_bes_preview_report as appropriate
the get_bes_full_report and get_bes_preview_report functions also initiate the simulation for any building that is not already 'Running' or 'Rated'


Connecting with SEED Platform
-----------------------------
Additional tools are available for use in building scripts to connect Building Energy Asset Score to the SEED Platform api, whether you choose to start your flow from either tool's front end interface, or by parsing csv files through either api.

py-seed::
    A python client for interacting with the SEED Platform api.  https://github.com/GreenBuildingRegistry/py-seed  see also https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed

jwt-oauth2::
    Provides a python client for authorizing SEED api connections using OAuth2 through a JWT grant flow.  https://github.com/GreenBuildingRegistry/jwt-oauth2
    Other OAuth grant type flows are available for connecting with SEED. See https://github.com/oauthlib/oauthlib, and https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit for information about clients for other grant types

usaddress-scourgify::
    Provides functionality for cleaning/normalizing address data. This tool was developed to assist in the process of parsing csv files into Building Energy Asset Score or the SEED Platform api to help ensure reliable address matching coming and going from either api. https://github.com/GreenBuildingRegistry/usaddress-scourgify see also https://github.com/datamade/usaddress

dubplate::
    Provides an immutable, dict-like structure for storing data, that may be defined with a fixed set of keys. That can also store additional meta-data like data as object attributes that can be accessed using dotted notation e.g. record.meta_attr.  Subclasses of the Record class can be used to good effect in handling data to be passed between one api and the other. https://github.com/GreenBuildingRegistry/dubplate

yaml-config::
    A Python client for reading yaml based config files. This tool was developed largely for the purpose in managing client access data such as password, org_token, etc.  https://github.com/GreenBuildingRegistry/yaml-config

pybes.utils also includes a create_bes_preview_bldg_from_seed function that uses the results of a single PropertyView record from a SEED api /api/v2/property_views/ endpoint call to build an appropriate Building Energy Asset Score preview payload which it sends to the create_preview_building endpoint.
bes_constants provides ADDRESS_MAP, PROPERTY_STATE_MAP, and SEED_STATE_FIELDS to assist in parsing Building Energy Asset Score results into SEED Platform api friendly payloads.

All above tools are open source packages and installable via pip.
